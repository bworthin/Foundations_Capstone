#Data Science Foundations: Project Ideas

###Topic 1: Determining trustworthiness of Yelp reviewers

[Yelp academic dataset](https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/dataset)

**Questions:**  
- How do users know which reviews to trust?   
- How can Yelp identify problem reviewers and reduce the impact of ‘fake’ positive or negative reviews skewing ratings?

I would work to identify patterns of behavior, reviewer profile, and comment characteristics that indicate untrustworthy reviews. If we assume as a starting point that the median rating of a particular restaurant approaches ‘truth’ as the total number of reviews increases, I could look at data for restaurants who meet a particular threshold for number of reviews, and examine responses that are significant outliers for patterns:  
- Are there reviewers who consistently give reviews that are significant outliers? (i.e. much more frequently than the average reviewer?)  
- Do they show a consistent pattern of giving either excessively high vs low reviews?   
- Are there indicators in behavior, comments, or profile characteristics that are associated with consistently outlying scores?  

**Outcomes:**  
This could be used by Yelp to remove suspicious scores from ratings calculation, or to flag specific reviews to let users know that they may not be reliable.  

**Issues:**    
- Can I get meaningful measures of outliers given that the scale is so small? (1-5 in increments of .5)  
- Is the volume of users giving multiple reviews high enough to be analyzed for meaningful patterns?    




###Topic 2: Predicting the next ‘hot’ housing markets

[House Price Index](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Pages/House-Price-Index-Datasets.aspx#atvol)  
- Under *Additional Data*, *Annual House Price Indexes*, [by Five-Digit Zip Codes](https://www.fhfa.gov/DataTools/Downloads/Documents/HPI/HPI_AT_BDL_ZIP5.xlsx) 
- Could use this to identify zip codes with large increases    
- Then find other data such as census data for demographics, city data for public works investment, etc.

**Questions:**  
- How can we predict what neighborhoods/cities are poised for rapid growth in popularity (as demonstrated by rising housing prices)?   
- What indicators can be used to predict such growth? 

I propose examining data for cities whose housing prices have seen significant growth (what constitutes that TBD)  over a particular period of time (5-10 years). Then, looking at data for the 5 years prior to the start of that growth, I could look for a pattern of characteristics for those cities that could be used to predict the increase in prices. This model could then be used to predict what areas are poised for similar growth in the next 5 years.

**Outcomes:**  
Real estate agents and potential buyers could get a better idea of what areas will be ‘hot’ over the next 5 years and likely to offer profitable investment opportunities

**Issues:**  
- Identifying what characteristics are likely to be predictive
- Finding appropriate data for those characteristics across a long enough time horizon.



###Topic 3: Predicting commercial bank failures based on customer complaints

[US Consumer Finance Complaints](https://www.kaggle.com/cfpb/us-consumer-finance-complaints)  
[Commercial Bank Failures, 1934-Present](https://www.kaggle.com/fdic/bank-failures)

**Questions:**  
Are there patterns in type/severity/handling of consumer complaints that are associated with bank failure and may be used to predict it?

I would cross-reference the consumer complaints data with the bank failure data to look for patterns in the failed banks that are significantly different from non-failed banks during a particular time period.  This might include:
- Type/severity of complaints
- Whether complaints were addressed/resolved and how long it took?
- Other indicators?

**Outcome:**  
Can be used to predict banks in danger based on customer complaint records.
